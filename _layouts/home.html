<p>I am a junior student at Shiv Nadar University and I am pursuing  B.Tech, Computer Science and Engineering. I'm currently working as an undergraduate research student under Opportunities for Undergraduate Research (OUR) offered by my university, where I'm majorly working on analyzing and mining impact caused by COVID using social media. The main objective of this project is to curb the spread of misinformation and hate comments related to COVID-19 data by categorizing it into sub-themes and further suggesting interventions to tackle the negative issues.
